description: "<p>Asana is a work management platform that helps teams orchestrate
  their work, from daily tasks to strategic initiatives. With Asana, teams are more
  confident, move faster, and accomplish more with less.</p><p>Coordinating work across
  teams can be chaotic. Teams now spend more time corralling work in email, chat,
  spreadsheets, and meetings than they spend performing their craft. Team members
  are inundated with requests and aren’t sure if they are working on the right things
  or if they are doing a good job. Team leaders worry about missing deadlines and
  having work fall through the cracks.</p><p>Teams need a system to orchestrate their
  work. With Asana, they have a living system where everyone can see, discuss, and
  execute the team’s priorities. Team members love Asana because it takes the guesswork
  out of work – they know what they need to do when, and they get recognized for the
  great work they deliver. Team leaders love Asana because it helps them feel organized
  and more connected to the work. They can see the team’s plans, track progress, and
  discuss the work – all in real-time. Asana replaces anxiety and being overwhelmed
  with work, with confidence and flow.</p>"
