  screenshot_description: "Our software solution is the key to your operational excellence.
    \nOur software allows you to experience full transparency over your vehicles and
    their maintenance needs and history. At the same time, the platform allocates
    open maintenance tickets, which require specific skill sets to qualified field
    operations staff. This is done automatically in real-time, and also plans optimized
    routes for field operations staff to run their work most efficiently. Optimization
    of operations is made possible by in-house developed algorithms and streamlined
    computer efficiency. Finally, tickets can be measured and prioritized according
    to SLAs such as reaction time or fleet uptime targets."
