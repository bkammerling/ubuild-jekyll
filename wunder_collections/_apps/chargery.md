  title: By enabling intelligent shared mobility operations we guarantee maximized
    fleet uptime alongside minimized operational costs
  screenshot_description: The Chargery software substantially increases the availability
    of vehicles in a shared fleet with a variety of features. The software solution
    allows you to finally experience full transparency over your vehicles and their
    maintenance needs and history. At the same time, the platform manages to allocate
    open maintenance tickets that require specific skill-sets to qualified field operations
    staff. This is done automatically and in real-time while also planning optimized
    routes for field operations staff to run their work most efficiently. The in-house
    developed algorithms and outstanding computing efficiency realize optimization
    of all operations dynamically. Finally, tickets can be measured against and prioritized
    according to SLAs such as reaction time or fleet uptime targets.
