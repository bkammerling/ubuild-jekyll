description: "<p>Most of us make journeys every day – whether we walk, cycle, hail
  a ride, or catch a bus or train. But when we leave our hometowns and familiar areas,
  working out how to make short trips at unfamiliar places can be difficult. Splyt
  exists to make those journeys easy; whether it’s the trip between the rail station
  and hotel or a way of exploring a new city. Our technology integrates local smart
  mobility – from ride-hailing to bike share – in the apps travelers already use.
  Let us bring you international customers and help them ride with you – via one simple
  integration and at no cost to you!</p>"
