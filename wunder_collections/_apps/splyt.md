description: "<p>How many people visit your cities each year? And yet how many of
  them never take a ride with you?</p><p>Think about it. Who wants to download an
  app for one holiday? Or set up an account in a foreign language and pay through
  an unfamiliar interface for one ride?</p><p>By joining Splyt's mobility marketplace,
  you remove those friction points. Instead, customers can find, ride and pay for
  your vehicles in their local apps. This might be their digital wallet, their journey
  planner or the app they used to book their hotel. We enable customers to use sustainable
  modes of transportation that are fitting to the cities they visit.</p><p>What’s
  more, we provide visibility. Our app partners, which include Alipay, Booking.com,
  Klook and more, encourage uptake through push notifications, banner ads and loyalty
  point systems - at no cost to you, as you keep 100% of the original fare.</p><p>So
  if you operate a fleet of scooters, bikes, mopeds or anything between, please reach
  out to learn more.</p>"
