description: "<p>myEGO is a digital, blockchain-based platform for self-determined
  identity (SSI) management, i.e. the user can control the ownership of his personal
  data and determine to whom and what information should be shared with third parties.
  A person's individual data points - his identity (e.g. ID card, driver's license,
  banking information, etc.) are verified, validated or attested by third parties
  through the myEGO platform. Our understanding is based on the idea of open, secure
  and user-centric ecosystems - myEGO thus revolutionizes the customer relationship
  between customers and companies through an innovative and sustainable onboarding
  approach. Multiple uses of (verified) user data assets can be linked across ecosystems
  and services, eliminating data silos.</p>"

  title: 'Data ownership:'
  screenshot_description: Car manufacturers and mobility providers collect vast amounts
    of different data, i.e. CO2 emissions, velocity, GPS etc. At myEGO, companies
    can also become data providers to benefit from data monetization (with the user’s
    consent).
