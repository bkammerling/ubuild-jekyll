  title: Real time safety warning system for micromobility users
  screenshot_description: The growing popularity of alternative transportation options
    – both shared and owned – has changed the urban mobility landscape. E-bikes, e-scooters,
    and hoverboards have become mainstream replacements for cars and public transportation,
    a positive trend that eases traffic congestion while allowing greater maneuverability
    on city streets.  However, unlike cars, which have multiple layers of protection,  micromobility
    vehicles typically lack any kind of safety warning system. To ensure its continued
    success and increase adoption, it's important to solve the problem of how to protect
    riders and vulnerable road users.
