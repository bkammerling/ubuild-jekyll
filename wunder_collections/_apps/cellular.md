  title: VTG solutions for efficient and sustainable fleet management
  screenshot_description: As an innovative booking and analysis platform, the traigo
    platform bundles the data from 95,000 rail wagons belonging to the rail logistics
    company VTG - for example, movement, vibration and temperature data. This does
    not only enable the company to create "predictive maintenance" scenarios, i.e.
    to plan maintenance and repairs in advance. It also allows VTG to offer customers
    data-based new services and test business models. Cellular is VTG's development
    partner.
