  title: 'Mobility is hyper local, so are payments '
  screenshot_description: 'As commerce is becoming increasingly global, payments are
    becoming increasingly local. Customers abandon their purchase when the experience
    is not localised (language, price, currency and payment methods). Apaya provides
    a fully localised experience to your customers, to maximise conversion. '

  screenshot_description: 'Local payment methods enable you to expand the business
    models you offer, to include single payments, membership, auto top-up, long term
    lease and wallet re-charge. Use these to create new revenue streams and remove
