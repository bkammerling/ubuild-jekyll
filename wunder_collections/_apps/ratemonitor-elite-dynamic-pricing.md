description: "<p>Taking a page from app-based car hire products, RateMonitor Elite
  supports you in employing a “surge pricing” strategy when your product is in demand!
  Alternatively, it helps you stimulate rentals by offering lower pricing when activity
  dips below normal, and you want to get your fleet moving. RateMonitor Elite helps
  you easily and effectively respond to – or drive- the market, all while increasing
  revenue!</p><p>By pricing with RateMonitor Elite, you can plan seasonal rates, special
  event rates, and even group discounts or other promotional rate strategies. It’s
  easy to plan ahead for the vacation season, holidays, or other occasions that impact
  demand for any and each of your products. All the while, adjusting for future competition
  and demand as it becomes more visible.</p>"

  title: RateMonitor Elite helps you price by demand, increasing revenue by 18% on
    average
  screenshot_description: There are two approaches to pricing; the first and most
    effective is where demand for a product drives pricing; the second is simple flat
    pricing – which is far less financially rewarding. RateMonitor Elite is the most
    successful competitive revenue management tool in the industry. Using RateMonitor
    Elite, your rental pricing is based on key market factors, including demand and
    inventory. Whether the demand for your product is steady or experiencing increased
    demand, your pricing is always optimal.

    pricing tasks, more gets done more rapidly, and your rates are more competitive,
    all without keystroke errors! You are freed up to operate your business instead
    of spending time heads-down, checking and entering constantly changing rental
    prices.
