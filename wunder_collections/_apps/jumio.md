  title: ID Verification
  screenshot_description: Establish the genuine identity of your users before letting
    them take the wheel. Jumio ID Verification verifies government-issued IDs in real
    time, employing advanced technologies to detect digital manipulations of genuine
    ID images, content (name, address, date of birth, etc.) and face photo replacements.

  title: Fraud Deterrence
  screenshot_description: Cars, e-bikes and scooters are high-value assets that must
    be protected against theft. Jumio’s identity verification and authentication solutions
    can help mobility-based businesses protect their fleets by ensuring that the person
    creating an account or leasing a vehicle is who they claim to be. By requiring
    a valid government-issued ID and a selfie, Jumio provides a valuable fraud-prevention
    tool, as fraudsters generally prefer not to use their own likeness when trying
    to scam the system.

  title: Liveness Detection
  screenshot_description: 'Given the rise of spoofing (the act of using a photo, video
    or a different substitute for an authorized person’s face), Jumio employs state-of-the-art
    liveness detection to ensure that the person creating the account or making an
    online purchase is physically present. Jumio leverages FaceTec for its advanced
    liveness detection and anti-spoofing capabilities — the only biometrics solution
    provider to pass Level-1 and Level-2 anti-spoofing results in NIST/NVLAP-certified
    iBeta Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) testing. When a new customer or driver
    creates an online account, Jumio captures an image of a government-issued ID and
    a 3D face map, which is instantly analyzed via AI to determine that the user is
    a living human and not a spoof. '
