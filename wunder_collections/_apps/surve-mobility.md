    in sharing fleets"
  screenshot_description: Our software solution is the key to your operational excellence.
    The software allows you to experience full transparency over your vehicles and
    their maintenance needs and history. At the same time, the platform allocates
    open maintenance tickets, which require specific skill sets to qualified field
    operations staff. This is done automatically in real-time, and also plans optimized
    routes for field operations staff to run their work most efficiently. Optimization
    of operations is made possible by in-house developed algorithms and streamlined
    computer efficiency. Finally, tickets can be measured and prioritized according
    to SLAs such as reaction time or fleet uptime targets.

  screenshot_description: We place significant value on our social responsibility.
    That’s why we abstain from using temp agencies and hire all of our service professionals
    in-house. Having our own highly-motivated team allows us to guarantee a high-quality
    and sustainable full-service for any kind of shared mobility provider in Europe.

  screenshot_description: We always stay ahead of the curve by developing our own
    infrastructure solutions, such as our state of the art warehouses, emissions free
    service fleets, various charging solutions and our decentralized micro hubs —
    all of which enable us to provide sustainable and highly-efficient operations
    for shared mobility fleets.
