  to control vehicle behavior based on that.</p><ul><li><p>Sidewalk detection (and
  resulting vehicle level decisions that can be taken).</p></li><li><p>Granular location
  categorization - specifically designated categories like a sidewalk, bike lane,
  crosswalk, street, and the possibility of taking specific vehicle level action based
  on those.</p></li><li><p>Parking verification &amp; management. Real-time ability
  to verify and enforce user parking in a designated area like corrals or docking

    Take your vehicle IoT intelligence to the next level with Drover PathPilot. Easy compliance with regulations, demonstration of superior safety capabilities for city RFPs, and potential reduction of insurance costs. PathPilot will provide you with unparalleled understanding of rider behavior by being precisely aware of where your vehicles are being ridden.
    Granular location categorization - specific designated categories like sidewalk, bike lane, crosswalk, street and possibility of taking specific vehicle level action based on those.

    • Infrastructure distinction - ability to identify specific areas like covered parking garages or building lobbies and take real-time vehicle level control - preventing users from taking scooters in those areas

getting_started:
- column_title: Provide us with hardware details on your fleet vehicles
  column_description: Vehicle make/model, battery specs, motor controller, etc.
- column_title: Tell us about your existing IoT module, if any
  column_description: If you already have an IoT module deployed on your vehicles,
    PathPilot simply serves as a secondary module that communicates the granular states
    of location with the parent IoT module which in turn takes any vehicle level decisions
    (speed reduction, etc).
- column_title: We customize a mounting bracket and design an integration plan.
  column_description: Chances are, we may have already worked with the vehicles you
    use but if your hardware is new to us, we customize a mounting bracket. On the
    software side, we help you with the integration of the APIs provided by Drover.
