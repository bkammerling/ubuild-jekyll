  title: Charging as a service (CaaS); user swapping ready.
  screenshot_description: |-
    The CaaS model offers the possibility for companies e.g. sharing providers (electric scooters and e-kickscooters) to use a Swobbee station exclusively for themselves and use them as a decentralised charging station for their own battery pool. Eliminating the need for expensive warehouses. On a further stage end user swapping can be added.

    The charging process is monitored 24/7. All batteries within a Swobbee station are protected and insured against any risks.
