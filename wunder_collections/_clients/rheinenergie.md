the_details: As a municipal energy supplier, RheinEnergie has long been a pioneer
  in electromobility. It was only natural for the company to launch an additional
  service for climate-friendly transportation, which it did by introducing 400 e-mopeds
  in the city of Cologne under the name rhingo. Powered by <a href="www.wundermobility.com/fleet"
  title="">Wunder Fleet</a>, rhingo is able to serve younger audiences and existing
  customers by bringing sustainable shared mobility to local hotspots.
