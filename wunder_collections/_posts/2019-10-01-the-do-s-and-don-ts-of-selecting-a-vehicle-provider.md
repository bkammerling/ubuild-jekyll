Choosing the right vehicles for your micromobility business is no small task. After settling on which vehicle type – bike, scooter, moped – makes most sense for your business model, it’s on to researching manufacturers and considering the countless models they have to offer.

This can be a bit overwhelming, to say the least. Though it might be tempting to choose the cheapest or coolest-looking vehicles you can find, it pays off to take your time and really consider your business needs and how the right vehicle type can support you.

That’s why we’ve compiled a handy list of do’s and don’ts to keep in mind when selecting a vehicle provider for your micromobility business.

### Don’t: Try to Strike Your Own Deals With Manufacturers

A classic mistake regardless of industry is assuming that bypassing a good provider and buying directly from an overseas manufacturer is a smart, cost-saving tactic.

Though nowadays many manufacturers do offer IoT devices with their vehicles, many do not use custom built IoT devices, which more often than not results in poor connectivity. And that in turn means that you and your clients cannot connect to your fleet of vehicles.

Imagine the pain of ordering a fleet of mopeds, shipping them back to your home country and then having to deal with retrofitting IoT devices onto all of them. This not only costs a lot of time, it’s also very expensive, negating the move of buying cheap at the start.

### Do: Find a Vehicle Provider Who Can Offer You a Complete Package

Instead of trying to piece together several components from different vehicle sharing companies on your own, why not save yourself some effort by going for the complete package deal?

Look out for mobility tech providers that offer package deals that also include software capabilities. Next to hardware, any successful micromobility operation will also want a white label user app, an efficient backend management system that provides a complete overview of user accounts and payments, in-depth analytics that will help you make well-informed decisions.

### Don’t: Buy Vehicles Off The Rack

With the influx of shared mobility services around the globe and with several brands competing for market share in a single city, it’s important to stand out.

How do you do this? With a strong brand identity on your vehicles. You’ll want to be able to customize everything with your own logo, colors and icons. This includes your branded user app (which can be achieved with a white-label solution as mentioned above).

Are you banking on having a neon color palette to attract tourists in a crowded city center, or are you going after commuters and business people by offering them a sleek, minimalistic look? Whoever your target market might be, customization can be an absolute dealbreaker, so it’s important to take that into consideration when sourcing your vehicles.

### Do: Consider Logistics As Vital

Once you’ve chosen your provider and placed your order of custom vehicles, it’s time to have them delivered to your location. Logistics is an often overlooked puzzle piece. A delay in delivery is a delay in your launch, so it’s vital to have a reliable logistics partner who can help you get your assets to you on time.
