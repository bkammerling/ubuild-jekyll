Over the last three months, our society has undergone massive changes. One of the areas where these changes have had the greatest impact is movement, or - as we like to we call it - **mobility.**

In order to help minimize the impact that these changes have had on the ground, we teamed up with the World Economic Forum at the beginning of the crisis to launch #WeAllMove, a tool aimed at filling information gaps around mobility for frontline workers. In this process, we were able to get in touch with over 160 operators in over 400 cities across the world including the likes of Share Now, VOI, Lime, Hertz and many more. These are in addition to the over 70 partners, ranging from operators to cities, in 6 continents that use our technology and products to power mobility services. Now, because of this, we are in a unique position to work with these stakeholders in order to bring to the industry an accurate insight on how shared mobility can supplement and relieve pressure from public transport infrastructure in light of the ongoing crisis.

A week back, we teamed up with our friends at Berylls Strategy Advisors to work on something that can translate this knowledge into a much more tangible form in order for us to distribute these learnings. After interviewing 12 of the most influential professionals from the most important sectors in mobility, we combined their learnings with our insights to publish this white paper.

The goal of this paper is to outline the role that shared and sustainable modes of transport can play in a COVID-stricken future by alleviating the constantly increasing pressure on more traditional forms of public transport. Download it today!
