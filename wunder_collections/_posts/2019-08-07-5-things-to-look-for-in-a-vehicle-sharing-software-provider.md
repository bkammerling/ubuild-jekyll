When launching a vehicle sharing service, you might be overwhelmed by the number of decisions you have to make, like which vehicles to choose or which market to launch in.

One of the most crucial choices is that of your mobility software provider. Though nowadays there are many on the market, they’re not all created equal. The future success of your mobility business depends on a comprehensive solution that meets your needs.

To help you in your consideration, we’ve compiled a list of five things you should look for in your vehicle sharing software provider.

### 1. Your mobility tech provider should include a white label and user-friendly app for your customers.

Your success as a future electric scooter, moped, car or bike sharing business rides on how much your customers enjoy using your service. In many ways, **the app that your users use to book rides is at the heart of your operation.**

That’s why it’s important that the app reflects your brand: It should have your company’s colors and logos, and should be easy to use, reliable and trustworthy. Simplicity is key. Users want to unlock their vehicles, ride, park and forget about them. The more cluttered and confusing your app is, the more likely you are to lose a customer’s business.

As a new company you will most likely not have the resources to build this app in-house. An experienced vehicle sharing software provider can support by providing a white label app that can be customized to your brand and is robust enough to scale with your business.

### 2. The operator dashboard must provide an in-depth overview and include all the details you need to manage your fleet effectively.

Managing user accounts is already a digital process, but that’s just one aspect of what should be included in the control panel of your fleet operations. A solid dashboard includes vehicle booking and ride histories, marketing services such as promotion codes or coupons you’re currently offering, all user account information including the user’s name and contact info, pricing options and payments, and of course [real-time vehicle information like hyperlocal data](https://www.wundermobility.com/blog/how-to-maximize-your-fleet-and-boost-revenue-with-hyperlocal-data.html) and routes.

### 3. A good vehicle sharing software provider will include analytics and reporting.

Damage and theft should of course be tracked, too. Though it’s a crucial aspect of monitoring your fleet operations, not all vehicle sharing software providers include reporting as part of the package. 

Data like most-traveled routes or the length and distance of an average ride can be used to your advantage. For example, being able to view multiple damage reports can help you make predictions about when your vehicles will need to go into the shop or be repaired before they actually break down. That’s useful information for anybody who wants to stay one step ahead of the competition. And a good software provider will include these insights in their reporting and analytics function.

### 4. Experience and a global track record are essential.

This consideration doesn’t apply just to software providers, but rather to every partner you’re considering doing business with. Do they have a list of clients or some big names in the industry that they’re working with already? If not, they might just be starting out - or they might not be very good at what they do.

If they’ve been on the market for a while but you can’t find evidence of successful partnerships with clients, they’re probably not prepared to help your business grow on a global scale. Always make sure you ask about current clients when talking to a sales rep. If they change the subject, consider it a red flag.

### 5. Make sure your vehicle sharing software provider can offer you a complete package.

By complete package we mean software (user app, operations dashboard, analytics), hardware (the vehicles for your fleet), and expert guidance. With an all-in-one solution, you can focus your attention on running your business while your mobility tech provider can supply you with all the tools to get your fleet on the road.
