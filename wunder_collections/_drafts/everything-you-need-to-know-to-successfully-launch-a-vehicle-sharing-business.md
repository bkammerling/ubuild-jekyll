Whether you’re a startup looking to make a positive change in the world of transportation or you’re an already established business exploring ways to expand your sustainability portfolio, launching a vehicle sharing business is a proven [business model](https://www.wundermobility.com/blog/free-floating-station-based-best-sharing-model.html) in the [mobility landscape](https://www.wundermobility.com/blog/sharing-economy-vehicle-sharing-car-ownership).

There are many benefits to vehicle sharing. Not only is it a more sustainable alternative to [car ownership](https://www.wundermobility.com/blog/sharing-economy-vehicle-sharing-car-ownership) with a positive impact on urban landscapes, it’s also predicted to be the [future ](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/04/future-of-transport-sustainable-development-goals/)of how people move.

Launching a new business is no easy feat, especially for industries like mobility where market regulations and user preferences can affect your entire business strategy. In order to help you navigate the launch of your vehicle sharing business, we’ve put together this comprehensive guide outline all of the steps you need to keep in mind. It covers everything, from the things you should consider before you go shopping for vehicles to how to calibrate your pricing model as soon as your fleet is ready to hit the streets.

## Getting to know your market and your target user

### Local laws and regulations

Before anything else, you will want to check with your local authorities to see what regulations you must adhere to. Every country and every city is different. Certain laws might prohibit the availability of micromobility in parts of the city center, for instance, which could seriously impact your business operations. This is the first step before getting into any other part of your planning.

### Target market and users

As with any business, you should know who your target market is before developing your product. Who is your customer? Which of their needs are you trying to address? What will make your vehicle sharing service [different](https://www.wundermobility.com/blog/how-to-make-your-shared-mobility-fleet-stand-out) from others already on the market?

### Vehicles for local preferences

It’s important to consider the geographic location of your vehicle sharing service in order to choose the right type of vehicle for the terrain and preferences of local users. Beach communities, for example, might prefer moving on bike, whereas inner city customers might prefer kickscooters or mopeds. And for snowy or rural landscapes, car sharing might make the most sense.

## Which vehicle sharing model is best for you?

By far one of the most crucial decisions for your fleet business is whether you want to offer your **vehicles in a free-floating or station-based business model.** Both certainly have their [advantages and disadvantages](https://www.wundermobility.com/blog/free-floating-station-based-best-sharing-model.html), however there might be a model that better suits your goals.

### What is free-floating vehicle sharing?

A free-floating model means that your vehicles are independent of a station and can be placed anywhere. As long as you comply with your city’s micromobility regulations, your vehicles can be strategically placed in hotspots where there is high demand. Users can book, ride and park your vehicles wherever is most convenient to them.

### What is station-based vehicle-sharing?

Station-based sharing means that users must pick up, park and lock your vehicles in a dedicated station. You can offer several stations within a city, and often it doesn’t matter which station users return a vehicle to. As an example, users could rent a bike in the city center and then later park it at a station that’s closest to their hotel.
