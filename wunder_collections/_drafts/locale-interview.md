## What was the idea or story that prompted you to launch Locale?

It is a well known saying that necessity is the mother of all invention. You could say our story is similar to that.

[Locale.ai](https://www.locale.ai/?utm_source=wunder&utm_medium=inbound&utm_campaign=interview) was born out of a personal problem. My co-founder and I used to work with mounds of geo data in our previous company, and there were no off-the-shelf tools that we could use. We had to build internal solutions and create tools to perform geospatial analysis.

While location data was in abundance, the tools to handle them weren’t. The idea of Locale dawned on us when we found out that multiple companies are looking to build geospatial teams internally. We asked ourselves, “_Could we build a product to empower local teams to get the right insights and spend time working on their core problems instead of writing queries?“_

I could go deeper into our journey, but you can also read more [here](https://blog.locale.ai/how-were-building-our-geospatial-analytics-product-using-first-principles-2/).

## What services do you provide today? What problems does your product solve?

With Locale, users have the ability to get **hyperlocal insights about their assets within minutes**. We make this possible through various analytics processes, like hex heatmaps, trips analysis, comparison analysis (to analyze supply demand gaps) and so on.

We provide for various use cases and a custom build based on your requirements. Some of them include:

* Marketing and growth teams can use Locale for **acquisition**

(expanding in areas of latent demand), **conversion** (identifying high user churn in areas) and **retention**.

* City and operations teams can use it for **allocation** (redistribution) **monitoring** and track **profitability.**
* Strategy teams and CXOs can use it for identifying **cancellations**, **delays & SLAs, productivity** and **overall revenue**.

Today, it takes 60-75 days and a team of 10 members (engineers, data scientists, analysts, ops managers) to run strategies on the ground. The analyst and engineering bandwidth become the biggest bottleneck to growth. When using multiple tools (BI tools, python, SQL,etc), building location cohorts takes 2-3 weeks. After finalizing the strategy, debugging & collaboration across disparate tools, takes 7-10 days. And yet impact evaluation & iteration is missing from the current process.

At Locale, we are solving this exact problem by **reducing time to insight by 300x by helping to create metrics and location-based cohorts** in minutes as compared to 2-3 weeks, **deploying localized decisions in 3 clicks and improving operational KPIs** by including hyperlocal nuances.

We envision a world where the pace of operational analytics and testing on ground is the same as analytics and A/B testing on products.

Who is a typical Locale customer? What segments and markets do you cater to?

An ideal Locale customer is any company with moving assets. This could be vehicles, driver fleets, delivery personnel and so on. We are currently working with

* Mobility companies (car sharing, ride sharing, ride hailing, micromobility companies and so on)
* On demand delivery companies
* E-commerce companies that have their own fleet or use 3PL services
* Logistics companies with mobile trucks and drivers
* Workforce companies with moving sales fleets

The use cases we work with are generally catered to operations and city teams to help them get a holistic view of the real word behavior of their users and on-ground assets without any engineering bandwidth. **Locale focuses on metrics like asset utilization, user conversion, user acquisition, cost per delivery and unit economics among others.**
