### Captcha 
To protect our web forms from automated requests, we use a Captcha function. Within the captcha function you may be asked to carry out a specific task or click on certain checkboxes. The user input required in this context and, if necessary, the mouse movements are used to determine whether the input comes from a person or an automated program.

As the Captcha function is provided by a third party, displaying the captcha will cause third-party content to be downloaded. This provides the third party with information that you have accessed our site and with the usage data technically required for this purpose. We have no influence on the further data processing by the third-party provider.

The legal basis for the embedding processing is our legitimate interest to protect against spam and abuse according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
