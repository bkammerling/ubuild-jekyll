    Wunder does not provide any transportation services and is not a transportation
    carrier.b. Wunder offers a technological platform, information and a method to
    connect Drivers and Passengers.c. It is up to a Driver of a vehicle to decide
    whether to offer a ride to a Passenger when contacted through the Wunder App.

    is a decision made in the Passenger’s sole discretion.d. All Trips, collection
    and destination points much be pre-agreed through the Wunder App and between drivers
    and passengers. Drivers may not collect passengers from any location which was
    not agreed via the Wunder App.e. Wunder is not and will not act as an agent for
    any User.f. The Wunder service is limited to providing a technology platform that
    allows Users to offer noncommercial car sharing in a private capacity. Activities
    which are for hire or reward in any commercial or professional context are not
    permitted. The only compensation for the service of car sharing or carpooling,
    wherein a private driver offers an empty seat in his/her car to a passenger, is
    the sharing of costs (fuel &amp; oil expenses, car expenses &amp; maintenance,
    insurance, cleaning of vehicle) of the trip, which would occur even if the trip
    was not shared with other passengers.g. Under no circumstances can a Driver using
    the Wunder app gain commercial or professional benefits. The Driver shall not
    provide any additional services to the passenger such as parcel delivery or other
    commercial services. If the Driver is using as professional vehicle (i.e. ride-sharing
    vehicle) with a regulatory licence, he/she shall not offer any carpools to passengers
    for hire or reward or any commercial purposes.h. Users are reminded that using
    the Wunder services and offering carpooling trips for hire or reward may invalidate
    their drivers’ licences and insurance and possibly cause adverse legal actions
    under applicable laws. Wunder is not liable for any loss or damage incurred as
    a result of any user breaching Wunder’s terms of conditions.i. Any breach of the
    above conditions will give rise to immediate suspension of the user account. Any
    future use of Wunder’s services may also be restricted.j. WUNDER HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY
    TO AND LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF ANY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES PROVIDED TO ANY PASSENGER

    accurate. Wunder will not be liable in the event that any information provided
    by another user is false, incomplete, inaccurate, misleading or fraudulent.not

    legal liability rules apply to members of our Community. Consequently, all claims
    between Community members in relation to the Wunder Community or Community rides
    must be agitated directly amongst the Community members. In the event of any dispute,
    Wunder may try to facilitate an agreement amongst the Community member but is
    not responsible for reaching a resolution. In the case of a legal dispute between
    Community members or if a Community member learns about the abuse of the Wunder
    App or of a behavior detrimental to other Community members or the Community per
    se, the member commits to inform Wunder immediately.InsuranceThe Driver agrees
    and undertakes that he or she will take out and maintain insurance to cover the
    Trip and any carpooling offered or booked through the platform. The Driver agrees
    that he or she will, on request, provide the Passenger with evidence in advance
    of the Trip of the complete validity of his or her insurance policy. The Driver
    shall also ensure that she/he has in place all insurances required under law,
    including third party insurance.The Driver also undertakes that he will hold a
    valid driving license and that the Driver will own or will be entitled to use
    the Vehicle and that the Vehicle will have authorization to drive and the Passenger
    is entitled to request evidence of the Driver’s insurance and driving license
    at any time up to completion of the Trip.It is up to each Driver and Passenger
    to confirm with each other that the Driver is covered by valid insurance for a
    Trip. The Driver must confirm that his or her insurance policy allows him or her
    to carry Passengers and that the insurance policy covers all Passengers and any
    accident or incident which may occur during a Trip.It is Wunder’s understanding
    that a Trip during which a Passenger contributes only towards travel expenses
    is not a Trip for “hire or reward”. A Passenger in such a Trip is a third party
    passenger who is covered by compulsory third party insurance. However, Wunder
    gives no warranty or assurance in this regard and it is the Driver’s responsibility
    to verify that their insurance provides adequate cover.The Driver and the Passenger
    are aware that standard non-commercial insurance policies may refuse to cover
    loss or damage arising in the event that the Driver had made or was seeking to
    make a profit. The Driver may collect no payment from the Passenger other than
    the Cost Contribution and the Driver must not, in any event, make a profit.The
    Driver, therefore, undertakes to calculate his or her expenses (fuel, toll, maintenance,
    repairs, depreciation, insurance, cleaning, interest of loan payment, loss in
    value of his or her Vehicle) and guarantees that the total Cost Contributions
    requested from his or her Passengers does not result in any profit. If the Driver
    does make a profit, or if the insurers repudiate or refuse to accept any claim
    arising during a Trip for any other reason, the Driver will be responsible for
    the financial consequences, losses, and damages arising and Wunder will not be
    liable under any circumstances to the Driver or the Passenger.The Wunder App proposes
    a suggested price for the trip, based on a fixed fee and costs per kilometer per
    ride of a standard vehicle used by Wunder drivers.The Driver may adjust the price
    per kilometer based on the actual expenses encountered by his vehicle. If the
    driver offers rides in medium or large sized vehicle, the likely expenses per
    kilometer will be higher and thus there is a possibility to adjust the pricing
    up to a maximum allowed price. The vehicle expenses may differ, depending on the
    model, year of purchase, fuel efficiency and level of maintenance of the car.
    Wunder is thus in no position to determine the final price of the ride.However,
    Wunder provides suggestions and limits any excessive pricing, which may be deemed
    to be commercial or for hire.DisputesWunder shall provide its Users with an online
    service for resolving disputes. This service is non-binding. Wunder is under no
    obligation to seek to resolve disputes and this service is offered at Wunder’s
    sole discretion and may be withdrawn at any time. If a dispute is not settled,
    Wunder reserves the right to retain any sums paid by the Passenger until an amicable
    agreement has been reached between the Passenger and the Driver or a definitive
    judicial decision has been made.<strong>6. COMMUNITY RIDES</strong>The core of
    the Wunder Community is to facilitate Community rides via the Wunder App. The
    Wunder App allows our members to organize shared rides ("") within a safe and
    trustworthy Community and to share any costs through a fair contribution to Drivers’
    expenses.No Contractual Relationship between Driver and PassengerWunder Community
    rides are favors between Community members. No contract (e.g., transportation
    contract) is made between Drivers and Passengers. The Wunder Community and the
    Wunder App must not be abused to facilitate contracts between Community members.
    Giving a ride based on a contractual obligation is not a Community trip even if
    the Wunder App is used to facilitate the trip. Claims against Wunder, especially
    for an invoice or the reimbursement of fees, cannot be based on such abuse.Cancelling
    TransactionsWunder has the right to cancel a transaction at any point in time
    solely at its discretion. Reasons for cancellation can include, without limitation:Drivers
    and passengers have not confirmed a Trip;There is no interaction between the Driver
    and Passenger on the Wunder App;Wunder finds a User acting against these Terms
    and Conditions.Banning of Drivers and PassengersWunder constitutes a circle of
    trust and it is important that these trust levels be maintained. As such, Wunder
    may, at its sole discretion, ban Users from the platform for any reason whatsoever,
    including but not limited to potential suspicious activity such as money laundering,
    fraudulent transactions via credit cards etc. We retain the right to report and
    cooperate with the local law enforcement in these cases.Cost SharingAfter finishing
    a Community trip, the Passenger shall contribute to the Driver’s expenses through
    the payment system integrated into the Wunder App. The Wunder App incorporates
    a proprietary cost sharing algorithm designed to calculate the cost of the ride
    and to share it between the Driver and the Passengers, equitably.In addition,
    Wunder reserves the right to charge an administrative fee for any ride. The amount
    is to be determined by Wunder, depending on its geography. The administrative
    fee covers costs for technology, services provided and support costs.<strong>7.
    PAYMENTS &amp; TAXES</strong>Participating in the Wunder Community is free.The
    Passenger shall not pay any reimbursement to the Driver for a Community trip beyond
    sharing in the cost of the Trip. Wunder does not process the payments towards
    costs by itself. Payments are processed by One Communications Limited (PayTM)
    in India or Dragonpay in the Philippines (""), which will process payouts and
    deductions ("") through a third party payment gateway (“”) for Wunder for any
    electronic payments.Wunder WalletIn certain countries, we facilitate payments
    through a closed wallet (the “” or “” in the Wunder app). All money uploaded to
    the Wunder Wallet is solely to be used to pay for Wunder Carpool rides.All electronic
    payments are only to be processed via the Wunder Wallet, supported by the Payment
    Provider. Wunder is not responsible for any delays or problems caused by or on
    account of the Payment Provider.Once a Community member contributes to Driver’s
    expenses or otherwise sets off a payment within the Community, the amount is charged
    to the payment method on file with our payment provider. Once a payment has been
    made to any Driver, the Payment (including any deduction or Administrative Fee)
    is nonrefundable regardless of the trip or any other disruption that was caused
    (including but not limited to accidents).Promotional OffersWunder may offer promotional
    offers to any User and these promotional offers are given at the sole discretion
    of Wunder. Any promotional discounts, offers and reward points in the form of
    Wunder Wallet money/points accumulated can be revoked without prior notice in
    the event of suspicious account activity or mala fide intent of the User.Cancelled
    TransactionIf a payment to the WunderWallet in respect of a cancelled transaction
    was successful, then the money is refunded to the Users. Wunder aims to make such
    payments within [90] business days, but cannot be held liable for any delays that
    are beyond its control.Bank AccountDrivers are required to create an account with
    our payment provider and record a functional personal bank account to receive
    any expense contribution payouts.Passengers are required to record a valid payment
    method with our payment provider using the Wunder App.Wunder has to be notified
    immediately and in writing about all inconsistencies in processing the expense
    contributions. If no claims are made within one month after an expense contribution
    is processed, it is considered as accepted by the receiver. If a deduction fails
    or is reversed, the debtor will immediately balance the missing amount. If the
    failure is due to reasons within the control of the debtor (e.g., the payment
    method on file is no longer valid or does not have sufficient coverage, a payment
    is reversed based on the order of the debtor, etc.), the debtor also has to cover
    any damages that occurred due to the failure. If the payout to the bank account
    on file fails Wunder will notify the Community member and ask that the bank account
    on file be corrected. The amount to be paid out will be added to the next regular
    payout and paid out at the same time as the next payout.Tax obligations of DriversIf
    you are driving, you agree to pay all taxes that may apply to the payments you
    receive from Passengers and this responsibility rests solely with you.<strong>8.
