&nbsp;

### 3\. Usage data

When you visit our website, our web server temporarily stores usage data for statistical purposes as a protocol in order to improve the quality of our website. This data consists of the following data categories:
- the name and address of the requested content,
- the date and time of the query,
- of the transferred data volume,
- the access status (content transferred, content not found),
- the description of the used web browser and operating system,
- the referral link, which indicates from which page you reached ours,
- the IP address of the requesting computer, which is shortened in such a way that a personal reference can no longer be established. 

The mentioned log data will only be evaluated anonymously.

&nbsp;

### 4\. Anonymous visitor measurement

On our web pages we make an anonymous visitor measurement. For this purpose, the protocol data of the web server as well as the abbreviated IP address are evaluated. Any conclusions about you are not possible.

### 5\. Storage of IP address for security purposes 

In addition, we store the complete IP address transmitted by your web browser for a period of 90 days in the interest of detecting, limiting and eliminating attacks on our web pages. After this period we delete or anonymize the IP address. The legal basis is Art. 6  (1) (1f) of the GDPR.

We take technical and organizational measures to protect your data as effectively as possible from unwanted access. We use an encryption procedure on our web pages. Your data is transferred from your computer to our server and vice versa via the Internet using TLS encryption. You can usually recognize this by the fact that the lock symbol in the status bar of your browser is closed and the address line begins with https://.

&nbsp;

### 7\. Cookies 

##### (a) Required Cookies
We use cookies on our websites, which are necessary for the use of our websites.

Cookies are small text files that can be stored and read on your end device. A distinction is made between session cookies, which are deleted as soon as you close your browser, and permanent cookies, which are stored beyond the individual session. 

We do not use these required cookies for analysis, tracking or advertising purposes. 

In some cases, these cookies only contain information on certain settings and cannot be linked to a person. They may also be necessary to enable user guidance, security and implementation of the site. 

We use these cookies on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (1f) GDPR. 

You can set your browser to inform you about the placement of cookies. This is in order to make the use of cookies transparent for you. You can also delete cookies at any time by using the appropriate browser setting and prevent the setting of new cookies.

### 8\. Third party tracking technologies for advertising purposes

We use cross-device tracking technologies so that based on your visit to our websites you can see advertisements tailored to your interests on other websites and we can measure how effective our advertising has been.
The data processing is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (1a) GDPR, if you have given your consent via our website banner. Your consent is voluntary and can be revoked at any time.

&nbsp;
##### (a) How does tracking work?
When you visit our websites, it is possible that those third-party providers listed below may retrieve identification characteristics of your browser or terminal device (e.g. a so-called browser fingerprint), evaluate your IP address, save or extract identification characteristics on your terminal device (e.g. cookies) or gain access to unique tracking pixels.
The individual characteristics can be used by those third parties to identify your terminal device on other websites. We may commission the relevant third parties to place advertisements based on the pages visited on our website.

&nbsp;
##### (b) What does cross-device tracking mean?
If you log on to the third-party provider with your user data, the respective identification characteristics of different browsers and terminal devices can be linked with each other. For example, if the third-party provider has created a separate characteristic for each laptop, desktop personal computer, smartphone or tablet you use, these individual characteristics can be assigned to each other as soon as you log in to a service of the third-party provider with your login credentials. This allows the third party to target our advertising campaigns across different devices.

&nbsp;

##### (c) Which third-party providers do we use in this context?
Listed below we specify those third-party providers with whom we work for advertising purposes. If the data is processed outside the EU or EEA in this context, please note that there is a risk that authorities may access the data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or having the right to appeal. If we use providers in unsafe third countries and you give us your consent, any transfer to a third country is based on Art. 49 (1a) GDPR.

&nbsp;

### 9\. Google Analytics
We use the web analysis tool "Google Analytics" to design our websites according to your needs. Google Analytics creates usage profiles based on pseudonyms. For this purpose, permanent cookies are stored on your end device and read out by us. In this way we are able to recognize returning visitors and count them as such.

Within the framework of Google Analytics, Google Ireland Limited and Google LLC support us. (USA) support us as processors according to Art. 28 of the GDPR. The data processing can therefore also take place outside the EU or EEA. With regard to Google LLC, no adequate level of data protection can be assumed due to the processing in the USA. There is a risk that authorities may access the data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or having the right to appeal. Please take this into account if you decide to give your consent to our use of Google Analytics. 

The data processing is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1 a) of the, if you have given your consent via our banner. The transfer to a third country takes place on the basis of Art. 49 (1a) of the GDPR.  

You can withdraw your consent at any time. Please follow this [link](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/) and make the appropriate changes.

&nbsp;

### 10\. Visitor measurement

These create usage profiles based on pseudonyms. For this purpose, permanent cookies are stored on your end device and read out by us. In addition, it is possible that we call up recognition features for your browser or terminal device (e.g. a so-called browser fingerprint or your unabridged IP address). In this way we are able to recognize returning visitors and count them as such. 

In addition, we use the following functions in the context of visitor measurement:
-  We enrich the pseudonymous data with additional data provided by third parties. In this way, we are able to record demographic characteristics of our visitors, such as age, gender and place of residence.
- We use a recognition method that allows us to record and subsequently evaluate the mouse pointer movements of our visitors. 

The data processing is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1a) of the GDPR, if you have given your consent via our banners. 

&nbsp;
##### Which third-party providers do we use in this context?

In the following, we will name the third-party providers with whom we cooperate in connection with visitor measurement. If the data is processed outside the EU or EEA in this context, please note that there is a risk that authorities may access the data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or having the right to appeal. If we use providers in insecure third countries and you give your consent, the transfer to a third country is based on Art. 49 (1a) of the GDPR.

&nbsp;

### 11\. Social plugins

You can use social plugins on our website. However, for reasons of data protection, we only integrate the social plugins we use in a deactivated form. Therefore, when you visit our websites, no data is transmitted to social media services. 

You can, however, activate and use the social plugins integrated in our websites. For this purpose, we use a solution by which our web server provides in a first step all data and functions required to display the social plugin. Only when you decide to activate the respective social plugin and click on the corresponding preview image or icon, in a second step your browser will establish a connection to the servers of the provider of the respective social media service. 

If you activate a plugin, the social media service receives in particular your IP address and, among other things, information about your visit to our websites. This happens regardless of whether you have registered an account with the respective social media service. If you are logged in, the data can be directly assigned to your social media profile. 

Overall, we have no influence on whether and to what extent the respective social media service processes personal data after activation. However, it is likely that the social media service will create user profiles based on your data and use them for the purpose of personalized advertising. Furthermore, your data will be used to inform other users of the social media service about your activities on our websites. 

The integration is based on your consent according to Art. 6 (1) (1a) GDPR, if you have given your consent by clicking on the preview image. Please note that the integration of many social plugins means that your data is processed outside the EU or EEA. In some countries, there is a risk that authorities may access the data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or having the right to appeal. If we use providers in unsafe third countries and you provide consent, the transfer to an unsafe third country is based on Art. 49 (1a) GDPR.

If you no longer wish your personal data to be processed by the activated social plugins, you can prevent future processing by no longer clicking on the preview image or icon of the respective Social Plugin

### 12\. Embedded videos

On our websites we embed videos that are not hosted on our servers. If you access web pages with embedded videos, content from the third-party provider who provides the videos will be downloaded. The third-party provider is thereby informed that you have accessed our website and receives the usage data that is technically required for this purpose. 

We have no influence on further data processing by the third-party provider. However, when embedding the videos, we have taken care to activate the extended data protection mode offered by the third-party provider. The extended data protection mode ensures that the third-party provider does not set any cookies. 

The embedding is based on Art. 6 (1) (1f) GDPR and in the interest of making our site as appealing and informative as possible.

We will only send you the newsletter if you have given us your express consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. After you have completed the newsletter registration on our website, you will receive a confirmation e-mail to the e-mail address you provided (double opt-in).

This may include storing the complete IP address at the time of the registration or confirmation of the newsletter, as well as a copy of the confirmation mail sent by us. 

The legal basis for the data processing is our legitimate interest to be able to account for the legality of the newsletter delivery according to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.

&nbsp;

### 14\. Direct Marketing

Where we receive your email address in connection with the sale of a product or service, we will use the email address for direct marketing of our own similar goods or services, unless you have objected to the processing. When collecting the address and for each use, we clearly point out that you can object to the use at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates.

&nbsp;

### 15\. Contact form
