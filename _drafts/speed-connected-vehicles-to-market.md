Imagine you are driving to your vacation destination, and you start your conference call from home while you are packing. When you get into to the shared vehicle, the route planning takes into account the best route for connectivity and easy driving, and adjusts the backseat microphone sensitivity during the call. Today, these experiences are constrained by either the center-stack screen, known as the in-vehicle infotainment device (IVI), or other specific hardware and software, which are determined while the car is being built. Instead, these experiences should evolve over a lifetime of ridership. There is opportunity for new, modern experiences that span the entire interior and systems of a vehicle, plus experiences outside the vehicle, to create deeper and longer-lasting relationships between car makers and their customers throughout the transportation journey.

To realize this opportunity, car manufacturers and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) providers need a connected vehicle platform to complete the digital feedback loop by incorporating the seamless deployment of new functionality. This is comprised of multiple, independently updatable services that reflect new understanding, at scale, and with dependable and consistent management of data, as well as services from Azure to and from three different edges: the vehicle, the phone, and the many enterprise applications that support the journey.

The [Microsoft Connected Vehicle Platform](http://aka.ms/mcvp) (MCVP) is the digital chassis upon which automotive OEMs can deliver value-add services to their customers. These service areas include:

* In-vehicle experiences
* Autonomous driving
* Advanced navigation
* Customer engagement and insights
* Telematics and prediction services
* Connectivity and over the air updates (OTA)

With MCVP – and an ecosystem of partners across the industry – Microsoft offers a consistent platform across all digital services: vehicle provisioning, two-way network connectivity, continuous over-the-air updates of containerized functionality, support for command-and-control, hot/warm/cold path for telematics, and extension hooks for customer/third-party differentiation. When built on Azure, MCVP includes the hyperscale, global availability, and regulatory compliance that comes as part of the Azure cloud. OEMs and fleet operators leverage MCVP as a way to “move up the stack” and focus on their customers rather than spend resources on non-differentiating infrastructure.

Automotive OEMs already taking advantage of MCVP, along with many of our ecosystem partners, include the [Volkswagen Group](https://news.microsoft.com/europe/features/volkswagen-and-microsoft-partner-to-create-new-automotive-cloud/), the [Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance](https://news.microsoft.com/2019/03/20/renault-nissan-mitsubishi-launches-alliance-intelligent-cloud-on-microsoft-azure/), and [Iconiq](http://iconiqmotors.com/).
