As 2019 draws to a close, we have much to reflect upon. This may very well have been our busiest year yet: marked by growth, expansion, and experimentation, but also happiness, excitement and new friendships, 2019 was a fast-paced rollercoaster ride, but definitely one with more ups than downs.

We’ve collected some of the biggest highlights of 2019 below for your reading and viewing pleasure.

In February, the release of the new **brand film,** shot on location in a number of international cities, highlighted our brand, our vision and our values. It was a stunning feat of our in-house video team, well received on social media and elsewhere.

Watch the brand film [here](https://www.wundermobility.com/blog/wunder-mobility-brand-film).

We launched the **Wunder Blog** - we now have a perfect platform for important news items, product launches and a variety of articles on everything from tips on starting a fleet-sharing company to opinion pieces on car ownership and the future of mobility. In July, we launched another channel, our **Wunder Instagram account**, to give members of the community the opportunity to take a peek at what’s going on behind the scenes at our offices and events.

Check out the [blog list page](https://www.wundermobility.com/blog) and follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wundermobility/).

We launched **Wunder Rent:** 100% online, keyless and paperless rental service software. Our goal is to help existing companies revamp their operations and go fully digital, as well as enabling new, free-floating rental companies to successfully get their business off the ground.

Our **Wunder City** tool went live in 2019. We’re honored to have been able to celebrate our first successful city partnership with the **City of Hamburg**, Wunder’s hometown. Our Wunder City tool maps and aggregates mobility data so that cities like Hamburg can use that data to better understand patterns and changes in their area, which in turn allows for smarter, greener, and better-informed decisions on infrastructure and urban planning.

As temperatures began to cool off and escooters became a more and more common sight on the streets of Germany - they were only made street legal in June - we got tangible confirmation of just how much Wunder Mobility has been growing in size and scope: we closed a **$60 million Series B funding round** with Blumberg Capital and KCK.

Shortly thereafter, **we opened our first North American offices** in Los Angeles, California and celebrated that milestone with a partnership event co-hosted by Fujitsu in San Francisco, the unofficial tech capital of the world. Since Wunder is a proudly international company serving clients across 6 continents and over 100 cities, expanding into the US market was a natural next step for us. Building a team of experts on-site who understand the innerworkings of the American mobility industry was of particular importance to us.

While further developing Wunder Fleet, we started to feel like an important part of the platform was missing from our portfolio: the vehicles themselves! That’s why we launched **Wunder Vehicles,** which are customizable, durable and shareable. Our vehicle team handles negotiations with manufacturers, logistics, storage and even financing options in order to make the vehicle selection process as seamless and hassle-free for our clients as possible. We’ve partnered with the world’s leading micromobility vehicle manufacturers to make a wide assortment of high-quality vehicles available, and we’re flexible, too: whether our clients prefer bikes, scooters or jetskis, we’re ready to find the perfect vehicle partner to suit each of their diverse needs.

As the weather started to take a characteristically rainy and windy turn here in Hamburg, it marked the nearing of our biggest event of the year, the Wunder Mobility Summit. **WMS19** took place on November 6th and 7th and spanned three floors of the Internationales Maritimes Museum, the Überquell Brew Pub (where the kickoff party was held) and of course the four offices here at the Wunder campus in Hafencity. High-caliber speakers like **John Krafick**, **Alexander Hitzinger** and **Alexander Maarten** took to the stage to share their insights. The Micromobility Test Track and vehicle and partner expos allowed curious attendees to play around with drones, e-vehicles, robots and VR glasses. Five early stage startups pitched their business concepts to a jury for the **Startup Stage Battle** - congrats again to Motiontag for winning first place!

It was an honor hosting such an influential, star-studded group of movers and shakers from across the mobility space and welcoming you all to our world and our home. We hope you enjoyed the event as much as we enjoyed throwing it!

We can barely wait to get started planning **WMS2020**. Make sure to watch this space in the coming months for updates!

At the beginning of 2019, we had just recently acquired the Fleetbird fleet sharing service company and welcomed our new Dortmund office and team to the Wunder family. We started the year with just over 100 employees, a monumental number considering our headcount at the beginning of 2018 (roughly 30!). Throughout the course of the year, just under **100 new team members decided to join the ride,** with even more newbies are set to be onboarded in 2020.

We’re incredibly proud of our progress, and we couldn’t have had such a successful year (or couple of years) without the help of our amazingly dedicated, always-passionate team. To all Wunderers reading this: **2019 was your year. Thank you for your hard work, creativity and unwavering team spirit during the past 12 months.**

2019 was defined by **growth.** We grew our team, our locations, our financial resource pool and our portfolio. Always motivated by the desire **to improve the quality of life in cities,** we expanded the scope of our vision dramatically. We went from three products to seven in a few short months, we opened offices half-way around the globe, we attended events in the Middle East, the USA, South America and Asia. We have lots of ideas on how to make 2020 an even more spectacular year than 2019. We have a lot to be excited about - ten years ago, shared mobility options outside of the public realm barely existed; autonomous cars felt more like a joke than a reality; the concept of an escooter probably would have been laughed at in the wake of some other failed initiative. Today, at the turn of the decade, we stand at the cusp of a new era of mobility: one that is autonomous, electric and **shared.**

It’s been a pleasure working, growing and scaling with you. 

From our family to yours:

_Merry Christmas & Happy New Year!_
