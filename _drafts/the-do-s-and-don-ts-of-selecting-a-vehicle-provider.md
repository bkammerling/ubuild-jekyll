So you want to start a vehicle sharing company. That’s great news! The only problem is, you can’t start a vehicle sharing company without - well, _vehicles_, and it’s not like you have a fleet of e-scooters or mopeds stowed away in your garage, eagerly anticipating your launch day and ready to be deployed at any moment.

If you can relate, don’t fret. We’ve already covered what to look for in an ideal software provider, but what about your vehicle and/or hardware provider? There are different factors to consider before simply picking the cheapest or coolest-looking vehicles you can find. That’s why we've compiled a handy list of do’s and don’ts to keep in mind when selecting your vehicle-slash-hardware provider.

### Don’t: Try to Strike Your Own Deals With Manufacturers

Let’s start with the classic rookie mistake, which is assuming you can bypass a good hardware provider and go straight to a vehicle manufacturer based overseas, order a veritable armada of e-scooters or mopeds at a jaw-droppingly low wholesale price and be on your merry way, praising yourself mentally for your cost-saving tactics.

Many manufacturers don’t include a built-in IoT device. Imagine the pain of ordering a fleet of mopeds, shipping them back to your home country and then having to deal with retrofitting IoT devices onto all of them - not only does that cost time, it costs money. Which brings us to our next point:

### Do: Find a Vehicle Provider Who Can Offer You a Complete Package

It’s kind of obvious, right? Instead of trying to piece together the components of a successful vehicle sharing company by yourself, why not go for the complete package deal that can offer you everything you need? 

A white label user app, an efficient management system that gives you a thorough overview of user accounts and payments, analytics that let you make well-informed decisions and of course the vehicles themselves should all be included in a solid, all-in-one vehicle sharing platform.

### Do: Make Sure Customization is an Option

Last but most certainly not least, if you want to start your own vehicle sharing company, you’ll want to be able to customize _everything_ with your own logo, colors and icons. This includes not only having a branded user app, but of course having branded vehicles as well. 

Are you banking on having a neon color palette to attract tourists in a crowded city center, or are you going after commuters and business people by offering them a sleek, minimalistic look? Whoever your target market might be, you know that the customizable factor is an absolute dealbreaker - brand visibility is, after all, everything.

Selecting vehicles for your fleet might seem like the most “fun” part of getting your concept off the ground, but it’s not exactly a walk in the park.
