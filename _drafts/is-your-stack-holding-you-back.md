If your company is anything like most shared mobility startups, you’re on a constant quest to **perfect the customer journey** for your users. You also probably understand that while parts of your business customers really see and interact with - like the vehicles themselves and the user app - are very important components of any successful sharing company, they shouldn’t be given more attention than your backend management or **your sharing software**.

Consider that software the glue that holds your business model together. Since it plays such a pivotal role in determining your sharing startup’s success, it’s not a bad idea to have an understanding of how the API your software is built on can either make or break your business. In case you need a refresher course on how a simple REST API flows, the graphic below is a great visual representation.

Let’s look at a real-world application of an open API. Perhaps you have a type of vehicle in your fleet which is only compatible with a specific, relatively uncommon IoT device. (It happens.) In order to ensure the seamless integration of that IoT device into your software platform, a dedicated team of developers will need to write the code that makes that device compatible - but before they even begin doing _that_, it’s hugely important that your platform is built on an open API. Otherwise, you’ll be forced to use the platform those devices were originally designed for, whether you like it or not.

**That kind of inflexibility can be costly.** If you have a young, dynamic business model and you’re looking to expand your operations quickly in the months and years to come, an open API is the only way to ensure that your entire business can scale at the rate you want. Customer demand can be fickle - open APIs ensure you’re one step ahead of the curve, and not trailing behind your users.

While that all seems fairly self-explanatory, many software providers only offer a closed API, limiting their customers as well as their customers’ end users. If your business is stuck in a contract or a system limited in scope, it might be time to ask yourself: is your stack holding you back?

It pays to give your customers a seamless experience. Modern users expect nothing less than perfection when trying out a new app. Make sure you can deliver them a seamless customer journey from the get-go by having software that matches your ambitions - go open!
