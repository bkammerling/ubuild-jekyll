If your company is anything like most shared mobility startups, you’re probably on a constant quest to **perfect the customer journey** for your users. You also probably understand that while the parts of your business customers really see and interact with - like the vehicles themselves and the user app - are very important components of any successful sharing company, they shouldn’t be given more attention than your backend management or **your sharing software**.

The main reason why an open API is better than its closed counterpart is that it can be easily customized to fit the needs of your business and it isn’t limited by software or tools you’ve already purchased - meaning it’s compatible with pretty much any program you can develop.

Let’s look at a real-world application of an open API. Assume you’re a founder of an e-bike sharing company, and you’d like to be able to send out a quick ‘thank you’ email to your customers after they take their first ride on one of your bikes. Maybe you’d like to send that email out through a popular client like Mailchimp so you can put your creativity to the test and impress your customers with your designs. 

In order to be able to provide your customers with the level of service they deserve, you _need_ an open API, which lets you configure your platform to be compatible with your programs of choice - like Mailchimp. If you had a closed API, you’d be forced to use the mail client that’s already been built into your platform.

Okay, so maybe you don’t care about Mailchimp, but it goes further than just email clients: perhaps you have a type of vehicle in your fleet which is only compatible with a specific, relatively uncommon IoT device. (It happens.) In order to ensure the seamless integration of that IoT device into your software platform, a dedicated team of developers will need to write the code that makes that device compatible - but before they even begin doing _that_, it’s hugely important that your platform is built on an open API. Otherwise, you’ll be forced to use the platform those devices were originally designed for, whether you like it or not.

**That kind of inflexibility can be costly.** If you have a young, dynamic business model and you’re looking to expand your operations quickly in the months and years to come, an open API is the only way to ensure that your entire business can scale at the rate you want. Customer demand can be fickle - open APIs ensure you’re one step ahead of the curve, and not trailing behind your users.

While that all seems fairly self-explanatory, many software providers only offer a closed API, limiting their customers as well as their customers’ end users. If your business is stuck in a contract or a system limited in scope, it might be time to ask yourself: is your stack holding you back?

It pays to give your customers a seamless experience. Modern users expect nothing less than perfection when trying out a new app. Make sure you can deliver them a seamless customer journey from the get-go by having software that matches your ambitions - go open!
