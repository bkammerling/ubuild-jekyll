If your company is anything like most shared mobility startups, you’re probably on a constant quest to **perfect the customer journey** for your users. You also probably understand that the parts of your business customers really see and interact with - the vehicles themselves and the user app - are the most important components of any successful sharing company.

> Software is the glue holding your business together.

After all, software is the glue holding your business model together. Since it plays such a pivotal role in determining your sharing startup’s success, it’s not a bad idea to have an understanding of how the API your software is built on can either make or break your business. In case you need a refresher course on how a simple REST API flows, the graphic below is a great visual representation.

That’s a pretty simple API, designed for convenience and flexibility, but **both established startups and first-time founders can benefit from an open API** like the one above. Why? Because whether you have ten vehicles or ten thousand, you want to be able to scale your operations when you want, and as fast as you want. To do that, you’ll need an API that can scale with you.

The main reason why an open API is better than its closed counterpart is that it can be easily customized to **fit the needs of your business** and isn’t limited by software or tools you’ve already purchased - meaning it’s compatible with pretty much any program you can develop.

Let’s look at a real-world application of an open API. Perhaps you have a type of vehicle in your fleet which is only compatible with a specific, relatively uncommon IoT device. (It happens.) In order to ensure the seamless integration of that IoT device into your software platform, a dedicated team of developers will need to write the code that makes that device compatible - but before they even begin doing _that_, it’s hugely important that your platform is built on an open API. Otherwise, you’ll be forced to use the platform those devices were originally designed for, whether you like it or not.

> Inflexibility can be costly.

**That kind of inflexibility can be costly.** If you have a young, dynamic business and you’re looking to expand your operations quickly in the months and years to come, an open API is the only way to ensure that your entire business can scale at the rate you want. Customer demand can be fickle - open APIs ensure you’re one step ahead of the curve, and not trailing behind your users.

While that all seems fairly self-explanatory, many software providers only offer a closed API, limiting their customers as well as their customers’ end users. If your business is stuck in a contract or a system limited in scope, it might be time to ask yourself: is your stack holding you back?

It pays to give your customers a seamless experience - modern users expect nothing less than perfection when trying out a new app. Make sure you can deliver them a seamless customer journey from the get-go by having [flexible software](https://www.wundermobility.com/) that matches your ambitions.
