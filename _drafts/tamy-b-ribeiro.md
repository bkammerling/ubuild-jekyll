In her short talk, Tamy highlights one of the major issues companies are facing today: innovate, or risk getting left behind. What's truly at the heart of innovation, anyway?

Additionally, the desire to own a car is decreasing 10% per generation, and half of Gen Z doesn't see the need to own a car.
