What makes the Mobility sector so attractive? 

Mobility is one of the key factors that make a city comfortable for living and attractive for visiting. This sector has been constantly changing thanks to new technologies that if used the right way can help to contribute to improving information exchange as well as the way mobility integrates itself into smart cities. As a result, this new paradigm generates many interesting opportunities for startups.

We see how technology is increasingly contributing to the development of mobility in the real and virtual world. The advanced functionalities of machine vision and image processing on mobile devices keep on improving virtual interaction and connections. On the other hand, we need to first be aware of what kind of challenges the industry is facing.

Challenges in the Mobility industry

Mobility enables the movement of people and goods. It is fundamental to any city. But increased mobility has its cons: traffic congestion, air pollution, etc. The gravity of these issues will escalate over time as the share of the urban population in the world will rise to 70% by 2050.
