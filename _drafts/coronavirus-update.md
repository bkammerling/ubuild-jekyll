Dear Wunder Community, 

In light of the Coronavirus pandemic that has been disrupting and endangering the lives of millions of people across the globe, Wunder Mobility has made the decision to transition the company to indefinite remote work.

We are an international company, with a global network of partners, friends and team members. We know there will be some difficulties for everyone during this adjustment period, which is why we will do our best to optimize our operations and smooth out any kinks in the system as we see them. 

We have also cancelled all events hosted at our offices until the end of June.

These are trying times, and it's hard to face uncertainty with courage. Nevertheless, we must use this opportunity as a chance to grow, adapt and strengthen the bonds of our team, which will prepare us for the future.

We wish you all good health and patience going forward. Please feel free to contact us with any questions. 

Sincerely, 

The Wunder Mobility Team
