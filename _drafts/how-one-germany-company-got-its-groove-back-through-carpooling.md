We were recently in the German university town of Marburg to visit our partners at **Pharmaserv**, the operators of Standort Behringwerke, a pharmaceutical park.

Pharmaserv was interested in finding new, smart solutions that could benefit their park. After debating between three different partners, they chose to work with Wunder Mobility on starting a carpool pilot.

Many employees who work at the Standort Behringwerke campus live in the countryside and find it **most practical to drive a car to work**. The Standort Behringwerke park-slash-campus is host to a total of 18 different companies, and **over 6,500 employees** commute to the Marburg campus on a daily basis. With so many people actively using the campus every day, efficiency is key. 

We sat down with **Thomas Madry**, Head of New Services at Pharmaserv, to talk about his company’s pilot with Wunder Carpool.

**Hey Thomas, why did you introduce corporate carpooling to the Standort Behringwerke campus?**

As the operators of a high-tech facility, we solve many problems for our clients every day. One of those problems is ensuring that our parking runs as efficiently as possible. We have limited space for vehicles here, which translates into lots of opportunities for finding innovative solutions and ways to organize carpools.

**What, in more concrete terms, were you trying to achieve by improving your parking situation?**

We had two main goals we were trying to achieve by improving our parking: to reduce traffic density, and to reduce the negative environmental impacts of traffic. Keeping these factors in mind, we decided that carpooling would be the best solution for us. 

We also knew that we wanted an **app-based carpooling system**. Ideally, the perfect app would allow employees to search, find and organize carpools on their own, as well as providing small incentives that encourage more people to use the app.

**Can you tell us a bit about how your partnership with Wunder Mobility came to fruition?**

In our daily business, it’s very important for us to develop solutions in a collaborative way with our customers. That’s why we decided to sit down with our clients to find out who could best serve our needs, and that’s how we landed on Wunder Mobility as our partner. We had seen other Wunder solutions in action and were very impressed.

**What’s your plan for the future?**

At the moment, we’re actively managing 50 parking spots with our carpooling app, and we expect that number to rise to about 200 by the end of the year. We think the potential is there to get **1600 active carpoolers** using the program.

**Why specifically did you pick Wunder Mobility as your partner?**

The biggest reason was that **we needed a partner who can act fast.** A lot of important daily business goes on on this campus, and we couldn’t risk putting any of that on hold while we redesign our parking system. We were also worried about security and wanted to make sure that everyone who parks on campus is actually supposed to be here, and Wunder Carpool includes a reliable system of identification. We also have a decentralized system here that Wunder can easily integrate with.

We were very pleased to find a partner like Wunder, whose agile software solutions matched our needs perfectly. We’re very satisfied so far!
