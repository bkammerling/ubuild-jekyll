We were recently in the German university town of Marburg to visit our partners at Pharmaserv, the operators of a pharmaceutical park.

Pharmaserv reached out to Wunder Mobility for help in solving a unique parking problem: the campus in Marburg is located in the countryside and isn’t easily accessible by public transportation, meaning that the majority of employees find it most practical to drive a car to work every day. To make matters more complicated, the Pharmserv campus is surrounded by a nature reserve, limiting the company in terms of expansion plans and the building of new structures.

To make matters more complicated, the Pharmaserv park-slash-campus is host to a total of 18 different companies (including well-known names like Siemens), and **over 6,500 employees** commute to the Marburg campus every day. You can probably already envision the **catastrophic parking situation** Pharmaserv found themselves in.

With no more room to breathe or expand and no viable transportation alternatives for employees, there were only two options left for Pharmaserv: move to a new location, or start an employee carpooling program. (Spoiler alert: they chose the easier, faster, more valuable option!)

  
We sat down with Thomas Madry, Head of New Services at Pharmaserv, to talk about his company’s problems and how they’re being solved by Wunder Carpool.

##### Hey Thomas, let’s dive right into the problems you were facing before calling Wunder Carpool for help! Why did you choose to introduce corporate carpooling to the Pharmaserv campus?

As the operators of a high-tech facility, we solve many problems for our clients every day. One of those problems is ensuring that our parking situation runs as efficiently as possible, which was not the case when we called Wunder for help. We have limited space for vehicles here - in fact, **some of our colleagues need to walk up to three kilometers to reach their desk after leaving their car.** We knew that needed to change.

##### What, in more concrete terms, were you trying to achieve by improving your parking situation?

We had two main goals we were trying to achieve by improving our parking: to ensure that **no parking spots go unused** and none of our limited space is wasted; and also to ensure that the fumes from idling cars do as little damage to our planet as possible - **sustainability is a top priority of ours.** Keeping these factors in mind, we decided that carpooling would be the best solution for us.

We also knew that we wanted an **app-based carpooling system**. Ideally, the perfect app would allow employees to search, find and organize carpools on their own, as well as providing small incentives that encourage more people to use the app.

##### Can you tell us a bit about how your partnership with Wunder Mobility came to fruition?

In our daily business, it’s very important for us to develop solutions in a collaborative way with our customers. That’s why we sat down with our clients to find out who could best serve our needs, and that’s how we landed on Wunder Mobility as our partner. We had seen other Wunder solutions in action and were very impressed.

##### We heard something about the reserved parking system you were able to build with Wunder Carpool. How does that work?

Our employees on campus often had to walk very far distances just to get to their office building after parking. That’s how we decided on a reserved parking system that incentivizes carpooling: all employees of one company can park directly in front of their building - in a spot that figuratively has their name on it - if they carpool together to work.

##### What’s your plan for the future?

At the moment, we’re actively managing 50 parking spots with our carpooling app, and we expect that number to rise to about 200 by the end of the year. We really believe in the potential of carpooling: we’re predicting that somewhere **between 1600 and 2000 parking spots will be onboarded into the carpooling system within the next few years already.**

##### Why specifically did you pick Wunder Carpool as your partner?

The biggest reason was that **we needed a partner who can act fast.** A lot of important daily business goes on on this campus, and we couldn’t risk putting any of that on hold while we redesign our parking system. We were also worried about security and wanted to make sure that everyone who parks on campus is actually supposed to be here, and Wunder Carpool includes a reliable system of identification. We also have a decentralized system here that Wunder can easily integrate with.

We were very pleased to find a partner like Wunder, whose agile software solutions matched our needs perfectly. We’re very satisfied with the test phase so far!

##### One last question: how do _you_ like the carpool app?

I’m lucky enough to live close to campus, so I ride my bike to work! But on the few separate occasions when riding a bike wasn’t possible for me, I was very impressed by how quickly and easily I could find a carpool group. It was nice talking to colleagues I would have never have had the chance to speak with, too.
