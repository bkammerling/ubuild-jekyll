[AutoMobility LA](https://automobilityla.com/) is a four-day media and industry event where the latest in transportation innovation is unveiled and demonstrated by emerging and established players, and where mobility experts discuss autonomy, connectivity, electrification, the sharing economy and other important factors shaping our future. It is a staple mobility event that I look forward to attending every year. The conference is held in Los Angeles — the nation’s top car-buying market as well as the top market for mobility and my personal hometown — [where we recently established our U.S. HQ](https://www.wundermobility.com/blog/wunder-mobility-launches-in-the-u-s).

AutoMobility LA’s 2019 Top Ten Automotive Startups Competition recognizes breakthrough technologies with the most potential to positively impact society and change how mobility is perceived and experienced. Startups focusing on automation, clean/sustainable mobility, advanced material, connectivity, manufacturing, and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) were invited to apply — and ten were selected to participate in a pitch session onsite at the event in front of some of the industry’s well-respected thought leaders, including Fontinalis Partners’ Dan Ratliff, New Mobility World’s Dirk Evenson, and Plug and Play Tech Center’s Fan Wen.

We are proud and honored to be recognized alongside other innovative mobility startups and look forward to the award ceremony on Tuesday, November 19th. Stay tuned and I hope to see you there!
