If you’re a frequent investor, you’re probably always on the lookout for a startup, concept or venture with potential. Perhaps you’re currently in the position of having received or allocated a sizable amount of cash to invest and you want to know exactly how to make the most out of that investment.

If so, you’ve come to the right place: read on for some tips on where and what to do with that money.

### Diversify

We hear it all the time: diversify, diversify, diversify. Why is it so important to diversify your assets, anyway? There’s a fairly simple reason: spreading your investments around doesn’t just increase the likelihood of getting a larger return, it also reduces risk. It makes sense - even if one investment ends up being a poor choice, the others are still left intact.

Diversification doesn’t guarantee a profit or protect against a loss, and a “complicated” portfolio is harder to keep track of than a simple one, but still, there’s some truth to the expression that you shouldn’t keep all your eggs in one basket.

### Choose Your Investment Path

There are two routes you can take when investing in a business: the first would be the “familiar” route - it’s not familiar because you’ve done it before, but rather because you find your way to the startup or business naturally. That could mean that you have a friend, connection or family member who has a cool idea they’re trying to get off the ground (and what’s better than supporting someone you actually know?) or that you have interest or experience in a specific industry and you think that can aid you in predicting market downturns.

> There’s no shame in admitting you have something to learn from the best.

The other route you can take requires a little more digging and searching. One excellent option is to attend a pitch event. It can be very inspiring watching entrepreneurs talk about what they’re most passionate about. Just make sure you always invest your funds based on ideas that seem credible to you, rather than basing your decision off the charisma or marketability of the entrepreneur doing the pitching. 

If you’d like to take an even more hands-off approach, we recommend investing through a venture investment platform, or even finding a syndicate to join so you can co-invest or be a backer to leaders who have far more capital and knowledge than you do. There’s no shame in admitting you have something to learn from the best - which brings us to our next tip:

### Outsource Investments (If It Makes Sense For You)

Outsourcing your investments comes with a multitude of benefits to a specific group of investors. If you have an in-house investment team that’s been costing you money, time and effort to manage, outsourcing your investments gives you more resources to focus on your business and other priorities, which then allows you to increase the efficiency of your existing operations.

> If you’re a busy investor, outsourcing might be the way to boost your investment strategy.

In-house investments do of course have the major benefit of (oftentimes) being much cheaper than outsourcing, which means that whether you outsource or not is often a direct result of how much money you want to invest in the first place. Additionally, outsourcing means a loss of direct control - someone else is essentially doing the work for you - but if you’re a busy investor who wants to make the most out of your resources, that might be exactly the right way to boost your investment strategy.

### Invest in Micromobility

Has investing in micromobility ever crossed your mind? If it hasn’t yet, consider this: cities are swelling globally - 68% of the planet will be living in cities in 2050 (1) - and since the average speed of many large, congested cities is around 11 kilometers per hour, (2) the market for micromobility should be a very tantalizing one. Any alternative to driving a car which is still faster than walking is arguably guaranteed to sell in the future. To put things into perspective even more, the market for micromobility in Europe alone is expected to reach a value of €150 billion by 2030 - and globally, it’s expected to reach €500 billion. (3)

> For investors looking to make the most out of their investment, there will always be plenty of fish in the sea.

If that’s not enough to convince you, some concrete examples might: Bond Mobility, a young startup from Palo Alto by way of Switzerland, recently received $20 million in Series A funding to introduce their dockless e-bikes (which can reach speeds of up to 45 km/h!) to the world. And that’s just one new player in a sea of competition - for investors looking to make the most out of their investment, there will always be plenty of fish in the sea.
