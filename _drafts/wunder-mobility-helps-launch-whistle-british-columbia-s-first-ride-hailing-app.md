Ride-hailing has revolutionized the way people move around the world. In many cities, people have grown used to being able to call a car with a few swipes on their smartphone screen, and in those same few minutes, they are instantly given an arrival time and cost estimate, all while being able to track where their ride is in real-time. While this is a reality in most metropolitan cities in North America, many smaller communities have yet to have these modern options available and have small fleets of traditional taxis available for locals and visitors to use. One area where this is the case is in British Columbia, Canada.

Enter Whistle!, the first ride-hailing company to be approved in British Columbia. Whistle! is a locally owned ride-sharing company that offers private and pooled rides in harder to get around parts of B.C., where there are few traditional taxis: Whistler, Tofino, Ucluelet, Pemberton, and Squamish.

By using local drivers to provide local rides, Whistle! is able to make more cars available during peak times helping to add needed ride inventory when traditional taxi companies are already busy. Whistle! allows riders to easily request a ride from their smartphone through their app, and their drivers are commercially certified, operate inspected vehicles and are background checked - so customers can have peace of mind when they travel with Whistle!.

Whistle! is using Wunder Mobility’s Wunder Shuttle technology to power its ride-hailing fleet. With Wunder Shuttle, Whistle! is able to effectively manage their fleet, and allows Whistle! to better serve their customers by leveraging Wunder Mobility’s technology and user-friendly app.

Helping startups launch and scale shared mobility services is a core part of Wunder Mobility’s mission and we’re proud to call Whistle! a partner.
