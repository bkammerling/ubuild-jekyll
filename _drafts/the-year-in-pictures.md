2019 started off with a bang. Our annual kick-off party was the perfect way to ring in the new year in style. Very cool people in sunglasses abound.

### APRIL

Another month, another edition of our Mobility Sessions! This time, we decided to host the event at our HQ in beautiful Hamburg.

The theme of the evening was voice AI’s influence on the future of ride-sharing. Sound intriguing? Find out when our next Mobility Sessions are coming to a [city near you](https://www.wundermobility.com/mobility-sessions/).

### JUNE

At any given time, we have at least three four-legged friends hanging out at the office. 

Wunder is a non-discriminatory, pup-friendly workplace that welcomes woofers and doggos of all sizes.

### JULY

Our Instagram account made its debut in July! Follow us [@wundermobility](https://www.instagram.com/wundermobility/). Also, yes, that is a skydiving Wunderer you see. 

The London edition of our Mobility Sessions were held at Kensington Palace. It was quite the royal affair.

### SEPTEMBER

September was a VERY exciting month for us: we officially opened our new US offices in sunny Los Angeles, a hub of emerging mobility! (Go Lakers.)

This month's Mobility Sessions were hosted in partnership with Fujitsu in San Francisco, the world’s tech mecca. We felt right at home there.

The fourth building on our Hamburg campus was open for business in October.

We have ample space for showing off some [Wunder Vehicles](https://www.wundermobility.com/vehicles) here - and taking them for a test ride, of course.

### NOVEMBER

With November comes our favorite event of the year: the [Wunder Mobility Summit](https://www.wundermobility.com/summit/) brought the greatest minds in mobility together for 1.5 days of exciting content.

The WMS19 afterparty has since become the stuff of legends!
