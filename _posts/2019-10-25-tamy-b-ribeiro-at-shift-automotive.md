### It's Time for a Change

In her short talk, Tamy highlights one of the major issues companies are facing today: innovate, or risk getting left behind. What's truly at the heart of innovation, anyway? Tamy suggests it's having the courage to face and even embrace change head on - to know when it's time to protect your company's traditional model, or when it's time to disrupt your own core business.

But don't just take her word for it - **S&P 500 Index metrics prove that the average company lifespan is shortening from 60 to 15 years.**

Additionally, the desire to own a car is decreasing 10% per generation, and half of Gen Z doesn't see the need to own a car.

**If that's not a wake-up call for companies, nothing will be.**
