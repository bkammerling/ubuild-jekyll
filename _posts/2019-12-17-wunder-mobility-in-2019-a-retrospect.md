As 2019 draws to a close, we have much to reflect upon. This was our busiest year yet: marked by growth, expansion and experimentation, but also happiness, excitement and new partnerships, 2019 was fast-paced and full of big changes.

We’ve collected some of the biggest highlights of 2019 below.

In February, we released a new **brand film** which was shot on location in a number of international cities Wunder technology has been deployed in. Shot entirely by our in-house video team, the brand film highlighted our vision and our values.

***

In the spring, we got tangible confirmation of just how much Wunder Mobility has been growing in size and scope: we closed a **$60 million Series B funding round** with Blumberg Capital and KCK.

***

We launched the **Wunder Blog** - we now have a perfect platform for important news items, product launches and a variety of articles covering everything from tips on starting a fleet-sharing company to opinion pieces on car ownership and the future of mobility. In July, we launched another channel, our **Wunder Instagram account**, to give members of the community the opportunity to see what’s going on behind the scenes at our offices and events.

We launched **Wunder Rent:** 100% online, keyless and paperless rental service software. Our goal is to help existing companies revamp their operations and go fully digital, as well as enabling new, free-floating rental companies to successfully get their business off the ground.

Our **Wunder City** tool went live in 2019. We’re honored to have been able to celebrate our first successful city partnership with the **City of Hamburg**, Wunder’s hometown. Our Wunder City tool maps and aggregates mobility data so cities like Hamburg can use that data to understand patterns and changes in their area, which in turn allows for smarter, greener, and better-informed decisions on infrastructure and urban planning.

A few months after escooters became a more and more common sight on the streets of Germany - they officially hit the streets in June - **we opened our first North American offices** in Los Angeles, California, and celebrated that milestone with a partnership event co-hosted by Fujitsu in San Francisco, the unofficial tech capital of the world. Since Wunder is a proudly international company serving clients across 6 continents and over 150 cities, expanding into the US market was a natural next step for us. Building a team of experts on-site who understand the innerworkings of the American mobility industry was of particular importance to us.

While developing Wunder Fleet further, we started to feel like an important part of the platform was missing from our portfolio: the vehicles themselves! That’s why we launched **Wunder Vehicles,** which are customizable, durable and shareable. Our vehicle team handles negotiations with manufacturers, logistics, storage and even financing options in order to make the vehicle selection process as seamless and hassle-free for our clients as possible.

We’ve partnered with the world’s leading micromobility vehicle manufacturers to make a wide assortment of high-quality vehicles available, and we’re flexible, too: whether our clients prefer bikes, scooters or jetskis, we’re ready to find the perfect vehicle partner to suit each of their diverse needs.

As the weather started to take a characteristically rainy and windy turn here in Hamburg, it marked the nearing of our biggest event of the year, the Wunder Mobility Summit. **WMS19** took place on November 6th and 7th and spanned three floors of the Internationales Maritimes Museum, the Überquell Brew Pub (where the kickoff party was held) and of course the four offices here at the Wunder campus in Hafencity.

High-caliber speakers like **John Krafick**, **Alexander Hitzinger** and **Alexander Maarten** took to the stage to share their insights. The Micromobility Test Track and vehicle and partner expos allowed curious attendees to play around with drones, e-vehicles, robots and VR glasses. Five early stage startups pitched their business concepts to a jury for the **Startup Stage Battle** - congrats again to Motiontag for winning first place!

It was a pleasure hosting such an influential, star-studded group of movers and shakers from across the mobility space and welcoming you to our home. We hope you enjoyed the event as much as we enjoyed throwing it!

We can't wait to see you next year at **WMS2020**. Make sure to watch this space in the coming months for updates!

We started 2019 with about 60 team members. Throughout the course of the year, just under **100 new team members decided to join the ride,** with even more newbies set to be onboarded in 2020.

We’re incredibly proud of our progress, and we couldn’t have had such a successful year without the help of our amazingly dedicated, always-passionate team. To all the Wunderers reading this: **2019 was your year. Thank you for your hard work, creativity and unwavering team spirit during the past 12 months.**

2019 was defined by **growth.** We grew our team, our locations, and our portfolio. Always motivated by the desire **to improve the quality of life in cities,** we expanded the scope of our vision dramatically. We went from three products to seven in a few short months, we opened a new office and we attended and hosted events in the Middle East, the Americas, Europe and Asia.

Ten years ago, shared mobility options outside of the public realm barely existed. The concept of micromobility becoming a viable mode of transportation seemed implausible in the wake of other failed mobility initiatives. Society was just starting to understand climate change and take the crisis seriously.

Now, at the turn of the decade, we stand on the cusp of a new era of mobility: one that is **autonomous, electric and shared.**

It’s been a pleasure working, growing and scaling with you all. Here's to another ten years of innovation, ideation and collaboration.

From our families to yours: happy holidays!
