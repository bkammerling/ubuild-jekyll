We’re happy to welcome one of Europe’s largest mobility operators to the #WeAllMove platform: Voi!

Swedish scooter sharing company Voi is famous for their coral-colored electric kick scooters - ubiquitous in every major European city these days - and their commitment to social and environmental engagement. **Today, we can proudly announce that Voi has decided to join the #WeAllMove initiative as part of the World Economic Forum’s Global COVID Action Platform.**

Voi is joining forces with us, the World Economic Forum, Hertz Autovermietung and Allianz Automotive to connect the world with mobility solutions. If Voi’s past record on social impact and their dedication to safety and sustainability are any indicator, they’re bound to inject more positivity and creativity into the #WeAllMove movement.

The weallmove.co platform was launched less than a week ago and has already united major industry players from across the spectrum, creating a much-needed conversation about the role of mobility during COVID-19 in the process. **Operators in over 105 cities and 29 countries have made their services available on the platform,** and the numbers are growing by the day.

We’re incredibly proud of our community and the commitment they’ve shown to breaking down barriers. Voi is no exception: even as COVID-19 began to spread rapidly and the company was forced to reduce the size of their operating zones, they quickly switched their focus to providing workers of essential services with safe, healthy rides to work. (Because that’s what heroes do.)

Defining a new mobility “normal” won’t be easy; these are uncharted waters for all of us. We’ll need passionate companies and people on our side if we want to design a future for mobility that benefits everyone equally and leaves no one behind. Voi is clearly run by a team of passionate people, which is exactly why we’re glad to have them onboard. During this time of crisis, we need all hands on deck.

Whether you’re a provider or a person who just needs a safe way to get to work, weallmove.co has you covered. Check out the platform and feel free to use the contact form to send us your questions and comments.

This platform is open to everybody who needs help moving around, not just mobility experts. That’s why we’re extending our invitation to you, too, to join the movement.

**Because if one of us moves, #WeAllMove.**
