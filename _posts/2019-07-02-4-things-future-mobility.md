Anyone who’s ever been stuck in a traffic jam or on a hot, overcrowded bus on the way to work knows that congestion is an extremely irritating and inefficient waste of time and money. Take New York and London as an example for example.

> 55% of the planet live in cities

### Cities are Expanding

More people live in cities now than ever before - 4.3 billion of them, to be exact. (5) That’s 55% percent of the planet already living in a city today, and that number is on the rise: in 2050, two thirds of the entire world population is expected to live in cities. (4) Expanding metropolises will have to come up with modern solutions to their complex problems - and fast! - if they hope to have a healthy, accessible transportation ecosystem in the future.

### Traffic is Harmful

How much do cities contribute to climate change? For one, 100 of the planet’s cities make up 20% of the world’s CO2 emissions. (1) We also know that traffic is one of the biggest causes of pollution in cities and that it reduces air quality significantly. (2) But that’s not the only effect crowded cities have on our health: people who spend long amounts of time stuck in traffic have much higher rates of chronic stress.

### Congestion is Costly

Anyone who’s ever been stuck in a traffic jam or on a hot, overcrowded bus on the way to work knows that congestion is an extremely irritating and inefficient waste of time and money. Take New York and London as an example: New York loses 33.7 billion dollars per year due to congestion, and in London it’s 12.2 billion dollars.(6)

### Attitudes are Shifting

Young people are less likely to purchase a car or a home than their parents were at the same age and are generally more drawn to the concept of equal access instead of ownership. (7) It’s time to start thinking about the old expression we learned when we were children: sharing really is caring!
